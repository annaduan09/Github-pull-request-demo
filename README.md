![Merge conflict vibes](https://github.com/annaduan09/Github-conflict-demo/blob/30794f50c655c91d7c05b2bed9a6432eb5646ee5/merge%20conflict.png)

In this demo, participants will learn the basics of using Github repositories for version control, and practice the following functions:  
- **Fork**   
- **Clone**  
- **Branch**   
- **Commit**   
- **Push**  
- **Merge**  

They will also get practice collaborating on repositories, including best practices for working simultaneously and resolving conflicts. Data for this activity comes from [OpenStreetMaps](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/), which is the theme for today in the #30DayMapChallenge.
